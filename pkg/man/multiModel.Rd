\title{Test multiple models of character transition at a single node}
\description{
  Compares up to five different models of character evolution: two models of no transition (Brownian motion and a single-
  optimum Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model); one model allowing transition at a single node in a whole-tree context; and two models 
  that split the tree into two subtrees and treat character evolution separately in the two trees (the \sQuote{censored} approach -- see
  discussion below).
}
\usage{
multiModel(phy, dat, node, 
           models = c("whole.brown", "whole.ou1", "whole.ou2", "part.brown", "part.ou"))
}
\arguments{
  \item{phy}{ An \pkg{ape}-style tree }
  \item{dat}{ A vector of data, with names corresponding to tips in \code{phy} }
  \item{node}{ A single node, defined by the tips that are descendent from it }
  \item{models}{ The vector of models, where \dQuote{whole} indicates a model in which the tree is treated as a single entity, and 
                  \dQuote{part} indicates a model in which the tree is subdivided and treated as two entities }
}
\details{
  This function is useful after you have identified nodes at which significant character transitions are likely to 
  have occurred. Its use is to identify whether shifts at a given node are compatible with a single Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
  (O-U) model with a change in equilibrium value at the node; a two-tree model, with each tree evolving under a 
  separate Brownian motion or O-U model; or a no-change model, either Brownian motion or no-change O-U model. 
  Details and discussion of biological interpretation of these models is in Hipp 2007.

  A list with two items:

  \item{modelMatrix}{A matrix of model parameters for the whole-tree models, the partial-trees models, and summed-partial-trees models}

\note{
  In \pkg{ouch} version 2.x, the \code{ouchtree} function rescales trees to depth = 1. The alpha and sigma parameters
  are thus not directly comparable between subtrees, as they were in previous versions of \pkg{ouch}, and this function as currently implemented
  should not be used to test for shifts in evolutionary rate within a tree (cf. O'Meara et al. 2006). Such a test can be performed
  in \pkg{geiger}, an \pkg{R} package, or \acronym{brownie}, which is available as a stand-alone application or a set of \acronym{MATLAB} modules.
