1. DONE: make allPossibleRegimes more efficient when maxNodes < length(nodes)
2. DROPPED: is the k-matrix a sensible statistic? fix it so it works on the revised batchHansen; average weight, or drop it
3. DONE: change paintBranches so that it automatically adds the root and knows what to do if it is handed a list of node vectors instead of a vector of nodes
4. DONE: make plot.ouSim smart enough to paint the branches according to the theta vector if no colors are provided
5. make a "simulate" method for a hansenBatch object that simulates the data using model-averaged parameters (including theta)
6. DONE: make paintBranches return a complete regime ready to plug into hansen, and modify calling functions accordingly
7. give plot.ouSim a way to highlight or circle or otherwise set off changeNodes 
8. DONE: make it easy to pass colors into plot.ouSim... the regime should pop out easily
9. make it possible to pass in a vector of lty or lwd to plot.ouSim so the branches can be different widths or patterns
