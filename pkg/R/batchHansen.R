# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# FUNCTIONS FOR PERFORMING A SERIES OF OU ANALYSES ON A BATCH OF TREES

## Changes needed:
## - measurement error portions need to be fixed
## - In a better world, allow graphical selection of subtrees to test on a single tree, then extract defining taxa
##    based on those nodes, using locator() or something like it.
